Student Career Aspiration Prediction Using Machine Learning
# Student Career Aspiration Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict students' career aspirations based on academic and extracurricular data. Using a RandomForestClassifier, the model classifies students into various career categories, aiding in career planning and educational guidance.

## Key Features
- Data Processing: Preprocesses academic and extracurricular features.
- Model Training: Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier for training on the dataset.
- Evaluation: Assesses model performance with accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- Prediction: Predicts career aspirations based on input features.

## Implementation
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and scaling
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Prediction and recommendations

## Results
Achieves ~81% accuracy in the current baseline models (Random Forest). Further improvements are possible with feature engineering and additional modeling.

## Future Work
- Enhance model accuracy with additional features and algorithms (LightGBM/CatBoost, stacking).
- Add advanced feature engineering and class balancing (SMOTE).
- Improve the web UI and deploy to a cloud host.
